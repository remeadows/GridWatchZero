# CONTEXT.md - Project Plague: Neural Grid

## Game Concept

**Project Plague: Neural Grid** is a cyberpunk idle/strategy game where you operate a grey-hat data brokerage network. Unlike standard idle games that focus purely on number growth, this game emphasizes **logistics optimization** and **network defense**.

## The Setting

You are an underground data broker in a dystopian megacity. Your network harvests ambient data from public mesh networks, processes it, and sells it to shadowy buyers. But you're not alone in the shadows.

**Malus** — a rogue AI threat actor — is hunting for fragments of **Helix**, a mythical dataset rumored to contain the keys to the city's entire infrastructure. As your operation grows, you become a bigger target.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. The Data Pipeline
```
[SOURCE] → [LINK] → [SINK]
   ↓          ↓        ↓
Generate   Transfer  Process
  Data    (Limited)  → Credits
```

The core tension: **Source output > Link bandwidth = Packet Loss**

Players must balance upgrades across all three components to maximize throughput.

### 2. The Threat System
Your **Threat Level** increases as you earn credits and upgrade infrastructure:
- Higher threat = more frequent attacks
- Attacks drain credits, reduce bandwidth, or disable nodes
- **Malus** becomes more aggressive at high threat levels

### 3. The Antagonist: Malus
- Adaptive AI that grows alongside the player
- Sends taunting messages as threat level increases
- Ultimate goal: Find data related to **Helix**
- Personality: Cold, methodical, speaks in corrupted terminal output

### 4. The Mystery: Helix
The endgame objective, revealed through lore fragments:
- "Helix isn't a dataset. It's a consciousness."
- "Malus was created to protect Helix. Something went wrong."
- "Every network carries a piece of it. Including yours."

## Visual Identity

**Aesthetic**: Terminal/Cyberpunk NOC (Network Operations Center)
- Dark backgrounds (#0D0D14)
- Monospace fonts throughout
- Neon accent colors:
  - Green (#33FF66) - Data, success
  - Cyan (#4DE6FF) - Links, info
  - Amber (#FFBF33) - Credits, warnings
  - Red (#FF4D4D) - Threats, damage

## Target Experience

The player should feel like they're:
1. Operating a mission-critical network dashboard
2. Constantly optimizing for efficiency
3. Under persistent threat from an unseen adversary
4. Uncovering a deeper mystery about Helix

## Inspiration

- **Idle mechanics**: Cookie Clicker, NGU Idle, Antimatter Dimensions
- **Aesthetic**: Hacknet, Uplink, Watch Dogs
- **Narrative**: Soma, Transistor (AI antagonist with personality)
- **Defense**: Tower defense genre (reactive upgrades to threats)
