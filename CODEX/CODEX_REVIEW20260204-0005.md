# CODEX Review - Balance Pass (2026-02-04 00:05)

## Scope

Document-only review of balance based on TestFlight feedback and project configuration. No code changes made.

## Skills and Connectors

- No applicable skills in the current skill list for TestFlight/Xcode control.
- No Desktop Commander (or equivalent) connector available in this environment, so I did not control Xcode or run the app.

## Inputs

- TestFlight feedback provided by the user (2026-02-04).
- Existing E2E test report: `E2E_TEST_REPORT.md` (dated 2026-01-27).
- Level configuration in `GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift`.

## TestFlight Balance Findings (User Report)

- Levels 1-4 felt easy.
- Level 5 felt hard; multiple failures.
- Levels 6-7 felt easier than Level 5; started with money.
- Level 8 felt impossible to earn enough credits to defend the network.
- Levels 9-20 not tested.
- Suggested adding a credit multiplier.

## Configuration Observations (From LevelDatabase)

- Level 6 starts with credits: `startingCredits: 1000`.
- Level 7 starts with credits: `startingCredits: 2000`.
- Level 8 starts with zero credits and jumps to high requirements:
  - `requiredCredits: 100_000_000`
  - `requiredDefensePoints: 3000`
  - `requiredReportsSent: 400`
  - `requiredAttacksSurvived: 60`
  - `startingThreatLevel: .ascended`
  - `minimumAttackChance: 3.0`

This aligns with the observed “Level 6-7 easier (started with money)” and “Level 8 impossible” feedback.

## E2E Balance Testing Status

Not executed in this environment. The existing `E2E_TEST_REPORT.md` validates UI flow and functionality but does not measure balance metrics (time-to-credits, defense survivability, or progression pacing).

## Balance Risks (Current)

- Level 5 feels like a difficulty spike relative to Levels 6-7.
- Level 8 is a major ramp with no starting credits and high objective thresholds.
- Credit pacing likely stalls at Level 8 under current threat pressure and required defense/report counts.

## Recommendations (Document-Only)

1. Add a per-level credit income multiplier for Levels 8+ (or specifically Level 8) to prevent stalls.
2. Consider giving Level 8 a small starting credit buffer similar to Levels 6-7.
3. Reduce one of Level 8’s concurrent requirements (credits, defense points, or reports) to smooth the first post-Helix tier jump.
4. Reassess Level 5 difficulty relative to Level 6-7 so the curve increases monotonically.
5. Add a balance-focused E2E pass with explicit metrics: time to required credits, fail rate by level, and attack survivability.

## Proposed Balance E2E Plan (When Xcode Access Is Available)

1. Run Level 1-8 with a consistent upgrade strategy.
2. Record time-to-completion, fail count, credits earned per minute, and defense points reached.
3. Repeat Level 5 and Level 8 with 3 different strategies (aggressive offense, balanced, defense-first).
4. Compare required thresholds against median time-to-reach to identify stalls.

## Next Actions Needed

1. Confirm whether to treat Level 8 as a single outlier fix or adjust Levels 8-10 together.
2. Decide preferred tuning lever: credit multipliers vs. requirement reductions vs. starting credits.
3. Provide access to an Xcode control connector if you want me to run full E2E balance passes.
