## 🇫🇷 French Localization (Optional but Recommended)

### Current Status
- ✅ English only
- ✅ Works fine in France (many gamers prefer English)
- ⚠️ French translation would increase downloads

### If You Want to Add French Later

**What needs translation**:
1. **App Store Metadata**:
   - App name (can keep "Grid Watch Zero")
   - Description
   - Keywords
   - Screenshots captions

2. **In-App Text**:
   - UI labels ("Start", "Settings", etc.)
   - Story dialogue
   - Tutorial text
   - Level names/descriptions

3. **Using String Catalogs** (Already Configured):
   - Your project has `LOCALIZATION_PREFERS_STRING_CATALOGS = YES`
   - Xcode can extract all strings automatically
   - Just add French localization in project settings

**Estimated Effort**:
- App Store metadata: 1-2 hours
- In-app strings: 5-10 hours (depending on story content)
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: ~1 full day of work

**ROI**:
- France App Store: ~40M users
- French localization typically increases downloads by 30-50%
- Worth doing after initial English launch is stable
