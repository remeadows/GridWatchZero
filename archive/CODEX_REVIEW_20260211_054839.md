# Executive Risk Summary
1. Save integrity is compromised by a load-path assignment bug (`malusIntel = malusIntel`), causing campaign/economy desync after relaunch (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1272`).
2. Combat telemetry and progression accounting are wrong because absorbed damage is not written back to `attack.blocked`, which invalidates blocked-damage stats and intel footprint progression (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:613`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:683`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1658`).
3. T7+ link progression is structurally broken because link tier inference hard-caps at `.tier6`, which can block higher-tier link unlock gates (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/Link.swift:126-134`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1049-1051`).
4. Campaign pacing can be bypassed for source/link/sink/firewall because `availableTiers` are not enforced in unit unlock logic; defense apps are gated, core units are not (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift:18-740`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/UnitShopView.swift:133`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1024-1031`).
5. Campaign checkpoint/offline loop can be exploited or feel lossy because exit does not force an immediate checkpoint save while offline bonus is checkpoint timestamp-driven (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:546-551`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/NavigationCoordinator.swift:588-593`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1339-1364`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1831-1845`).

# Critical Issues
1. `malusIntel` save-load restoration bug.
- Evidence: `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1272`.
- Impact: saved intelligence state is silently lost across sessions; campaign objectives, intel bonuses, and report pacing drift from expected progression.
- Launch risk: high probability of player trust loss due to non-deterministic progression.

2. Blocked damage not persisted into attack instance.
- Evidence: damage absorbed computed at `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:613-617`; blocked value consumed later at `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:683-688` and `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1658-1662`.
- Impact: campaign `damageBlocked`, engagement tracking, and intel footprints underreport, making balancing and telemetry invalid.
- Launch risk: core combat loop cannot be trusted.

3. Link tier progression capped at Tier 6 by implementation.
- Evidence: `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/Link.swift:126-134`.
- Impact: T7+ links can fail tier gate checks even when player has appropriately advanced links.
- Launch risk: soft-lock risk in late game campaign/endgame progression.

4. Campaign tier caps not enforced for non-defense unit unlocks.
- Evidence: campaign exposes `availableTiers` per level (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift:18-740`), but unlock path checks only credits + tier gate (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1024-1031`); unit list shows all units for category (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/UnitShopView.swift:133`).
- Impact: players can economically bypass designed campaign pacing on source/sink/firewall chains.
- Launch risk: campaign integrity failure.

5. Save & Exit does not hard-save campaign checkpoint immediately.
- Evidence: auto-save checkpoint cadence every 30 ticks (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:546-551`), exit flow only pauses + exits (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/NavigationCoordinator.swift:588-593`).
- Impact: recent progress may be lost; offline bonus can be applied repeatedly from stale checkpoint windows.
- Launch risk: perceived data loss and exploitable economy swings.

6. Late campaign pacing math is structurally inconsistent with victory goals.
- Evidence: Level 20 requires Defense Tier 25 and 135B credits (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift:700-738`), while Defense Tier unlock costs escalate to 10Qi at Tier 25 (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/DefenseApplication.swift:778-806`).
- Impact: objective credits become non-representative; practical gating shifts entirely to extreme tier unlock grind.
- Launch risk: endgame session-length blowouts and abandonment.

# High Risk Issues
1. Campaign header credits progress uses current wallet credits, not `levelCreditsEarned` used by victory checks.
- Evidence: UI (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/DashboardView.swift:1308-1315`) vs victory logic (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1948-1954`).
- Risk: player confusion and false negative/positive interpretation of objective progress.

2. Insane requirement multipliers are declared but not applied in victory condition evaluation.
- Evidence: multipliers present in `LevelConfiguration` (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignLevel.swift:284-301`) while victory uses base `VictoryConditions` (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1932-1954`).
- Risk: advertised difficulty contract does not match runtime behavior.

3. Legacy campaign iteration still targets only Levels 1-7 in helper path.
- Evidence: `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:172-179`.
- Risk: hidden progression bugs in menus/recommendations and PM confusion when triaging progression defects.

4. Transient runtime states are not consistently reset across mode transitions.
- Evidence: `activeEarlyWarning`, `batchUploadState`, `latencyBuffer` are not cleared in major reset/start paths (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1739-1743`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1915-1919`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1403-1411`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1468-1474`).
- Risk: cross-session contamination and hard-to-reproduce bugs.

5. Attack frequency can be driven too low in Endless due stacked reductions and no mode floor.
- Evidence: reductions at `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/DefenseApplication.swift:1143-1144` and `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/DefenseApplication.swift:1593-1601`; generator uses `minimumChance` from level config which is absent in Endless (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:738-745`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignLevel.swift:314-315`).
- Risk: passive/no-pressure Endless sessions and exploit farming.

6. Story cloud sync is knowingly incomplete.
- Evidence: campaign save uploads `StoryState()` placeholder (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:459-462`).
- Risk: cross-device narrative mismatch.

7. Test suite misses critical integration defects.
- Evidence: tests are mostly structural/placeholder (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZeroTests/SaveSystemTests.swift:121-129`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZeroTests/AttackSystemTests.swift:210-238`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZeroTests/BalanceMultiplierTests.swift:140-167`).
- Risk: blocker regressions can re-enter quickly.

# Medium Improvements
1. `AttackDamage.processingReduction` is authored in attack models but not applied in threat processing.
- Evidence: field definition at `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:756-760`; no use in active threat application path (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:584-694`).
- Improvement: either implement or remove to prevent false balancing assumptions.

2. Deprecated and noisy save strategy in runtime paths.
- Evidence: extensive print logging and `UserDefaults.standard.synchronize()` in hot save loops (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1191-1240`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:219-241`).
- Improvement: production logging gates and async-safe persistence telemetry.

3. Threat progression API usage ignores campaign-level parameterization.
- Evidence: `ThreatLevel.forCredits(... campaignLevel: Int = 1)` exists (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:174`) but `ThreatState.updateThreatLevel()` calls `forCredits(totalCreditsEarned)` without campaign context (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:818-823`).
- Improvement: explicit mode-aware threat evolution policy.

4. Campaign progression remnants still assume legacy Tier-6 cap.
- Evidence: tier unlock writeback capped to `<= 6` (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:329-330`).
- Improvement: remove obsolete progression state path or align fully with 25-tier architecture.

5. Runtime messaging mismatch around risk semantics.
- Evidence: UI copy says effective risk drives attacks (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/Components/ThreatIndicatorView.swift:83`) but generator uses raw threat (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:305-309`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:870-873`).
- Improvement: align text or behavior.

# Low / Polish Suggestions
1. Remove tutorial/debug-heavy print noise from gesture-heavy UI (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/Components/NodeCardView.swift:28-82`).
2. Normalize style comments that still reference pre-20-level game shape (for onboarding clarity).
3. Convert hard-coded sample/demo index access patterns to safer guards where they touch preview/debug-only arrays.
4. Tighten mission-exit language so “auto-saved every 30 seconds” clearly states potential last-window loss.
5. Clarify campaign objective widgets so spent credits cannot be interpreted as objective regression.

# Balance Observations
## Global Economy and Weapon Effectiveness
- Core production scales aggressively with tier base stats but upgrades are cheap relative to unlock costs for source/link/sink/firewall (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/Node.swift:78-86`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/Node.swift:145-157`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/Link.swift:67-86`).
- Defense app unlock costs (T13+) and required defense tiers dominate pacing far more than listed credit objectives in late campaign (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/DefenseApplication.swift:778-806`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift:447-740`).
- Risk reduction remains a major power axis because attack frequency reduction is still applied in generator, despite comments saying defense should focus on damage (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:858-873`).
- Firewall and defense-stack reductions can yield very low effective incoming pressure while maintaining high report farming potential, especially outside campaign floors.

10. Edge cases: without an explicit minimum attack floor, high reduction builds can trivialize pressure and distort economy.

# Architectural Risks
1. Monolithic core files increase change risk and regression blast radius.
- Evidence: `GameEngine.swift` 2203 lines, `DashboardView.swift` 2194 lines, `DefenseApplication.swift` 1626 lines, `NavigationCoordinator.swift` 1314 lines.
- Risk: difficult ownership boundaries, high merge conflict rates, and slower QA isolation.

2. View layer directly observes multiple global singletons plus engine state.
- Evidence: `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/DashboardView.swift:8-15`.
- Risk: hard-to-predict redraw chains and hidden coupling between gameplay and meta systems.

3. Campaign and Endless policies are mixed in one engine path with mode branches.
- Evidence: frequent `isInCampaignMode` branching through core tick and persistence logic (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:508-551`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1682-2025`).
- Risk: bug fixes for one mode regress the other.

4. Progression model has partial legacy assumptions after expansion to 20 levels/25 tiers.
- Evidence: stale loops and tier cap remnants in campaign progress (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:172-179`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:329-330`).
- Risk: future content additions will re-open old defects.

# Performance Risks
1. Unmanaged repeating timers in views can outlive expected lifecycle.
- Evidence: `Timer.scheduledTimer` without retained handle/invalidation in `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/Components/CriticalAlarmView.swift:242-248` and `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/StoryDialogueView.swift:391-418`.
- Risk: memory and CPU drift in long sessions.

2. High-frequency debug logging in save and interaction loops.
- Evidence: `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1191-1240`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/CampaignProgress.swift:219-241`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Views/Components/NodeCardView.swift:28-82`.
- Risk: frame-time variance and unnecessary I/O noise, especially on device.

3. Save cadence and immediate verification work on main actor.
- Evidence: synchronous encode/write/verify sequence in `saveGame()` (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1191-1240`).
- Risk: hitching during frequent save windows.

4. Long-session attack/event density in late levels (L15-L20) increases UI and audio event pressure.
- Evidence: high minimum attack floors in level definitions (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift:520-740`) plus frequent alert/event rendering paths.
- Risk: sustained battery and thermal pressure.

# Unexpected Strengths
1. Level content is data-driven, explicit, and easy for designers to reason about (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/LevelDatabase.swift:18-740`).
2. Defense stack taxonomy is rich and coherent across 25 tiers with clear category differentiation (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/DefenseApplication.swift:50-157`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/DefenseApplication.swift:850-927`).
3. Campaign checkpoint model captures substantial runtime state (units, levels, stack, intel, unlocks), which is a solid foundation for robust resumes (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Engine/GameEngine.swift:1768-1791`).
4. Threat and attack taxonomies support high thematic range and future extensibility (`/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:9-171`, `/Users/russmeadows/Dev/Games/WarSignalLabs/GridWatchZero/GridWatchZero/Models/ThreatSystem.swift:334-470`).
5. Campaign structure now consistently defines 20 levels with narrative continuity and clear unlock chain intent.

# Recommended Next Actions
1. Fix launch blockers first: `malusIntel` load assignment, blocked-damage accounting writeback, T7+ link tier inference, and immediate checkpoint save-on-exit.
2. Enforce campaign `availableTiers` in engine unlock path for source/link/sink/firewall, not only in defense UI.
3. Reconcile objective semantics: use one credits metric across UI and victory logic, and either apply Insane requirement multipliers or remove them from design/UI.
4. Run a progression balancing pass for L11-L20 with explicit target completion windows and unlock-cost curves; verify Tier 25 viability against intended median session length.
5. Add integration tests for all blocker paths (save/load intel, blocked-damage accounting, tier gate T7+, campaign-tier enforcement, checkpoint/offline exit path).
6. Remove hot-path debug logs and deprecated `synchronize()` usage from production runtime loops.
7. Audit and fix untracked repeating timers in overlays/dialogue views.
8. Clean residual legacy assumptions in campaign helpers (`1...7`, `<=6`) to align fully with 20-level/25-tier model.
9. Perform a dedicated late-level performance profile pass on target iPhone and iPad hardware with L15-L20 scenarios.
10. Re-run full QA matrix for campaign normal/insane + endless after fixes before App Store submission gate.
